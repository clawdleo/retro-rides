### 1. INTRODUCTION POST (First Post)
```
Some bikes deserve a second life.

I'm building Pat Ina – a home for the mountain bikes that defined an era. The Kleins, Yetis, and Fat Chances that pioneered a sport.

Not restorations. Not repaints. Just honest preservation.

Every scratch tells a story. Every worn decal is a badge of honor.

Based in Central Europe. Shipping across the continent.

Follow the hunt. 🦌
