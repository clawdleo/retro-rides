## Content Don'ts

❌ Never post bikes you don't own as "for sale"
❌ Don't use stock photos
❌ Don't oversell condition - be brutally honest
❌ Don't spam hashtags (5-10 max on IG)
❌ Don't engage in price wars publicly
❌ Don't trash talk other sellers

## Content Do's

✅ Show the flaws - builds trust
✅ Tell the story of each bike
✅ Engage with the community genuinely
✅ Credit original sources if sharing others' content
✅ Respond to DMs within 24 hours
✅ Be consistent - better 3x/week forever than daily for a month

## Photography Guidelines

### Equipment
- Phone camera is fine (modern phones)
- Natural light (golden hour is chef's kiss)
- Clean background (concrete, wood, nature)

### Required Shots per Bike
1. Full bike, drive side (the "hero shot")
2. Full bike, non-drive side
3. Head tube / brand badge
4. Rear triangle detail
5. Component group (shifters, derailleurs)
6. Any flaws / damage (honesty builds trust)
7. Serial number (for provenance)

### Style Tips
- Slightly lower angle makes bikes look better
- Negative space is your friend
- Show scale (in use, or against something)
- Detail shots: fill the frame

## Pricing Display

Always show:
- Price in EUR (€)
- "Shipping available" or shipping cost
- Condition rating (1-10 or description)
- Key specs (size, groupset, year)

Never:
- "DM for price" (looks sketchy)
- Hidden fees
- Unrealistic prices without justification
